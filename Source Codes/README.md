To execute python source codes, we need to install Python 3 environment. The current version has been tested on Python 3.7. 
It is recommended to install Python virtual environment for the tool with the following packages: 

* numpy == 1.19.2
* pandas == 1.1.5
* scikit-learn == 0.21.2
* scipy == 1.7.3
* tensorflow == 2.2.0
* Keras == 2.4.0

After installing the required packages, we can execute "inferDataPrecondition.py" to obtain data precondition 
with a trained DNN model and dataset from specific directory. 
In order to get the unseen data prediction with DeepInfer, we need to execute (unseenPrediction.py) python file.
